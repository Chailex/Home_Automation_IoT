HOME AUTOMATION



Technolgy and components Used ->

1. IFTTT protocol
2. Blynk 
3. NodeMCU Modeule
4. DHT22 sensor
5. Couple of motors
6. LED
7. Google Assistant



DESCRIPTION ->



With the use wifi module that is NodeMCU I have tried to make a home automation project in which I have shown how we can use google assistant to control our home devices such as fan, light, washing machine, TV and everything else that is connected to electricity. I have used a temperature sensor(DHT22) which turn on the fan whenever the temperature of the room rises above some threshold temperature which is set in the arduino code. I have included google assistant to control all devices present in my project and also the devices can be controlled by adroid app named as Blynk where triggers are set for the respective devices. The technology which is interfacing google assistant and NodeMCU is IFTTT(if this than that).
